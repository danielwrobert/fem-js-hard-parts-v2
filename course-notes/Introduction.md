# Section 1: Introduction

In this course we cover 5 key areas of JavaScript:

- Underlying JavaScript principles: How does code actually run in JavaScript?
- Higher-order functions and callbacks (a key part of functional programming)
- Closures: one of the most elegant and beautiful features of JavaScript - the bit that if you get your head around truly, truly understand it from first principles, you understand many of the core pieces of the JavaScript engine.
- Classes and Prototypes (OOP).
